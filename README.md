Assignment 1 
Making a website for German football club, Borussia Dortmund. Advertise the club and show their history,
Advertise items in the shop, and show the lateset news + the club players.

The website is made for football fan(mainly Borussia Dortmund fans)or anybody who is interested to find out more about Borussia Dortmund. They can look at the website and understand more about the club by reading up on their history. They can also see when is their next fixture and how the club previous match went. They can also find any player in the club and find out more information about them. Lastly they get to see the items sold in the shop and also read latest news of the club. This is like a smaller version of their actual website which gives them insights of how their website looks like and help bring a bigger community to their website.

Wireframe
I did my website to be the same as my wireframe initially but was met with a few problems.
I couldnt exactly code out the way i wanted and had to find different ways to get it done.
I also decided that "Fixtures" and "Tickets" should not be included and therefore decided to change to "Club" and "History". 
I felt that "Fixtures" was not a good feature as i already showed it in the home page
The Ticket feature was not a good idea as well as i would just link it to the actual page so i decided i should share more about the club by implementing "Club" and "History"
The mobile wireframe was created only after i was done with my website design therefore it included "Club" and "History"

It will include a home page, news page, shop page, club page and finally a history page of the club.

My first page is a home page. It will have a navigation bar on top(Included in all of the pages). There will be a club logo at top left to symbolise the club. The background will be yellow(For all pages) as i it the colour of the club. I included a picture of the team to welcome the viewers into the website with a club photo. Finally there is a previous and next fixture image to inform the viewers on when is the next game.

The next page is a news page, in which viewers can find resourceful news and information about the club. (The navigation bar and the background colour is the same for all *except the change of news to home*) 
included 3 videos with title to the side to show what the team has been up to in the recent days. At the bottom of the website is web article with accesible link from the image to the real article. Also included a short title to capture the audience attention.

The next page is a shop page, in which viewers can find items they would like to purchase which is related to the club. (The navigation bar and the background colour is the same for all *except the change of shop to home*) Added a picture of the captain Marco Reus as a "Model" to show the viewers how the shirt would look like. Below the model is the pictures of the more popular items sold in the shop that might interest the viewer. It have a wide variety from tshirts to caps to bag and even to masks.
The "Select" button links to the real website of the club that sells the item

The next page is a club page, in which viewers can find the list of players who play for the club from goalkeeper all the way to the attackers.(The navigation bar and the background colour is the same for all *except the change of club to home*) It have a title "Team Squad" before introducing the whole team categorized in "Goal", "Defend", "Midfield" and lastly "Attack"

The next page is a history page, in which viewers can find out more about the history of the club and how it became such a prosperous club.(The navigation bar and the background colour is the same for all *except the change of history to home*)There will first be a introduction on how the club was formed, and it got its name and how it rise to become a top club in the footballing world. it is in a box so its easier to read. They will then scroll down to find the "Trophy" section in which it shows how many trophies the club have won over the years. There is also a click me button which changes the "?" to reveal how many trophy they have actually won.

I used html, css and javascript to create this website.

The website will be able to be displayed on a computer and from the size of an iphone6/7/8 plus. The navigation bar is able to access different pages of the website.The "select" button of the shop and the "click me" button in the trophies will be able to do the necessary actions.
